This is the final project report of Physical Design for Nanometer ICs (Spring 2021). Macro legalization is an important step in todayâ€™s placement flow. In this work, a constraint-graph based macro legalization algorithm flow which combines iterative refinement and simulated annealing is applied to solve the macro legalization problem. Experimental result shows the flow could achieve a balance between cost and runtime.
