I am currently a research assistant at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html), where I received my B.S. in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) in June, 2022. I am applying for EECS Ph.D. in the US for Fall 2023. 

My research interests lie in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and electronic design automation (EDA). In my current research, I work with [Prof. Iris Hui-Ru Jiang](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=24040) on timing analysis, optimization, and machine learning for EDA, and collaborate with [Prof. Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/), [Prof. Qi Zhu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/zhu-qi.html) from Northwestern University, and [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/) from Liverpool University on the design and verification of cyber-physical systems, especially for connected and autonomous vehicles.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://kevinchang73.github.io/assets/pdf/resume_202204.pdf).
