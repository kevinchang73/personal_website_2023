I am currently an senior undergraduate student in the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html). I will apply for a Ph.D. program in EECS/ECE for Fall 2023. My research interests lie in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and electronic design automation (EDA).

In my first undergraduate research, I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Iris Hui-Ru Jiang](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=24040) on timing analysis and machine learning for EDA. In my second undergraduate research, it's my honor to collaborate with [Prof. Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/), [Prof. Qi Zhu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/zhu-qi.html), and [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/) on the design and verification of cyber-physical systems.
