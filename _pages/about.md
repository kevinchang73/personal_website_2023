I am currently a research assistant at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html), where I received my B.S. in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) in June, 2022. I am applying for EECS Ph.D. in the US for Fall 2023. 

Currently, I work with [Prof. Iris Hui-Ru Jiang](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=24040) on graph neural network (GNN)-based timing macro modeling, and work with [Prof. Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/), [Prof. Qi Zhu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/zhu-qi.html) from Northwestern University, and [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/) from Liverpool University on the design of a safety-guaranteed framework for neural network-based planners of connected and autonomous vehicles.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://kevinchang73.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_2022_10.pdf).

## Research Interest
My main research interest is the design, modeling, verification, and safety of **cyber-physical systems (CPS)**, especially for (but not limited to) the application to **autonomous vehicles** and **transportation systems**. I am also interested in **electronic design automation (EDA)**, with a focus on timing analysis and optimization, physical design optimization, and machine learning for EDA.
