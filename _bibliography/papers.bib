  abstract={Neural-network-based (NN-based) planners have been increasingly used to enhance the performance of planning for autonomous vehicles. However, it is often difficult for NN-based planners to balance efficiency and safety in complicated scenarios, especially under real-world communication disturbance. To tackle this challenge, we present a safety-guaranteed framework for NN-based planners in connected vehicle environments with communication disturbance. Given any NN-based planner with no safety-guarantee, the framework generates a robust compound planner embedding the NN-based planner to ensure the overall system safety. Moreover, with the aid of an information filter for imperfect communication and an aggressive approach for the estimation of the unsafe set, the compound planner could achieve similar or better efficiency than the given NN-based planner. A comprehensive case study of unprotected left-turn and extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},

  abstract={Due to rapidly growing design complexity, timing macro modeling has been widely adopted to enable hierarchical and parallel timing analysis. The main challenge of timing macro modeling is to identify timing variant pins for achieving high timing accuracy while keeping a compact model size. To tackle this challenge, prior work applied ad-hoc techniques and threshold setting. In this work, we present a novel timing macro modeling approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs). A timing sensitivity metric is proposed to precisely evaluate the influence of each pin on the timing accuracy. Based on the timing sensitivity data and the circuit topology, the GNN model can effectively learn and capture timing variant pins. Experimental results show that our GNN-based framework reduces 10% model sizes while preserving the same timing accuracy as the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, taking common path pessimism removal (CPPR) as an example, the generality and applicability of our framework on various timing analysis models and modes are also validated empirically.},
